# Employee Attrition Prediction - Portfolio Project

This repository contains an end-to-end data analytics and machine learning project aimed at analyzing and predicting **employee attrition**.  
The goal is twofold:  
1. **Exploratory Analysis** â€“ Identify key factors influencing attrition.  
2. **Predictive Modeling** â€“ Build models that predict which employees are most likely to leave.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- **[Excel] - Employee Attrition Data**  
  Contains Excel files used for initial exploration, descriptive statistics, and manual cleaning.  

- **[Machine Learning] - Employee Attrition Prediction**  
  Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) covering data preprocessing, handling class imbalance (SMOTE, class weights), and predictive modeling using Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.  

- **[PowerBI] - Employee Attrition Data**  
  Interactive dashboards built in Power BI to visualize attrition trends, employee demographics, and model results.

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Models
- **Logistic Regression** â†’ Baseline model with class-weight adjustment, strong operational interpretability.  
- **Gradient Boosting & XGBoost** â†’ Benchmark models to evaluate performance and capture non-linear relationships.  

Evaluation metrics include **precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC**, and confusion matrices to balance business interpretability with predictive power.

## ðŸ“Š Business Insights
- Identifies key drivers of employee attrition (e.g., job role, overtime, years at company).  
- Provides HR teams with **actionable insights** through dashboards.  
- Supports **data-driven retention strategies** by combining descriptive and predictive analytics.

## ðŸš€ Tools & Technologies
- **Excel** â†’ Initial cleaning & EDA  
- **Python (Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Imbalanced-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** â†’ ML workflows  
- **Power BI** â†’ Dashboarding and visualization
